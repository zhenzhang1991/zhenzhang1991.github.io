Greetings! I am a researcher at the College of Mathematics and Physics, Chengdu University of Technology (China). I am interested in the emerging properties and non-trivial behaviors in a range of disordered materials, such as oxides glasses, metallic glasses, and granular matter. I use state-of-the-art computational and numerical methods to probe and understand the physics behind the intriguing properties of these systems.

# Research highlights

## 1) Uncover hidden order in disordered systems

Disordered systems such as liquids and glasses have a rich structure that is otherwise hidden if characterized with standard structural measures such as static structure factor. We devised a novel four-point correlation method that allows detecting structural order in liquids on length scales beyond short range. We numerically demonstrated that hard-sphere like systems have a icosahedral orientational order while the prototypical network system silica has a orientational order with tetrahedral symmetry, both of which extending to intermediate and larger distances. Further experimental studies on granular matter and dense colloid liquids have demonstrated that this four-point correlation method indeed allow unraveling the hidden intermediate-range structure and it connections to the particle packing and dynamical heterogeneity in these systems.

## 2) Deformation and failure of amorphous solids
The deformation and failure of amorphous materials are much less understood when compared with their crystalline counterparts. This is primarily because of the disordered nature of amorphous structure which makes that even defining structural defects is a very challenging task. 
For metallic glasses, by combing conventional MD method and a highly efficient swap MC algorithm, we have produced computer glass models with a effective cooling rate approaching that typically used in experiments. This hybrid simulation scheme thus allowed successfully bridging the vast timescale gap that has been a long-standing concern for comparing lab glasses with the computer-simulated ones. Further analysis of the slowly-quenched glass has revealed that that shear transformation zones are considerably fewer and smaller than previously believed and cannot be attributed to clear-cut local defects that can be predefined in the glass structure.

For silicate glasses, we have recently investigated their mechanical behavior under tensile loading using large-scale MD simulations. It is found that the non-linear elastic properties of the glasses are originated from the synergy of heterogeneous response of the network structure and the stress-relaxing local coordination environment change of the alkali modifiers. We also found a composition-mediated brittle-to-ductile transition of the nanoscale fracture behavior of the glasses, which can be attributed to change of heterogeneities in various atomic-level properties.

## 3) Monolayer surface properties of silicate glasses

Surface properties lie at the core of many applications of silicate glasses. In our recent work we combine large-scale classical MD simulations with first-principles calculations to investigate the characteristics of silicate glass surfaces on the level of single atomic layer. Our MD simulations revealed the presence of structural defects that are potential reactive sites on the surfaces. Their vibrational and electronic signatures were further identified jointly from the classical and ab initio simulations. Moreover, the large-scale simulations allowed to study the topographical features of the melt-quenched surface and the fracture surface of the glasses. It is revealed that the melt-quenched surface is considerably smaller than the fracture surface. The Fracture is found to exhibit a logarithmic scaling of the surface height fluctuation, indicating that it is not fractal object on the nanometer scale.

## 4) Irradiation of structurally and chemically complex materials

High- and medium-entropy alloys (H/MEAs) are an emerging type of materials with great potentials in both structural and nuclear applications. Recent studies have shown that a salient feature that sets these alloys apart from pure metals and dilute solid solutions is their chemical complexities in the form of local chemical order (LCO). Combining atomistic simulations with in situ ion irradiation experiments of a representative CrCoNi MEA, we demonstrated that increased LCO significantly enhances its resistance to irradiation damage by narrowing the mobility ratio of irradiation-induced interstitials and
vacancies that can facilitate their recombination.  This finding opens an avenue towards the design of structurally and chemically complex materials with superior irradiation tolerance.
