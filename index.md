# Research highlights

## 1) Uncover hidden order in disordered systems

Disordered systems such as liquids and glasses have a rich structure that is usually hidden if characterized with standard structural measures such as the static structure factor. We recently devised a novel four-point correlation method that allows detecting structural order in liquids on length scales well beyond nearest neighbors. We numerically demonstrated that hard-sphere-like systems have an icosahedral orientational order while the prototypical network-forming system silica has an orientational order with tetrahedral symmetry, both of which extending to intermediate and larger distances. Further experimental studies on granular matter and dense colloid liquids demonstrated that this four-point correlation method indeed allows unraveling the hidden intermediate-range order and it connections to particle packing efficiency and dynamical heterogeneity in these systems.

## 2) Deformation and failure of amorphous solids
The deformation and failure of amorphous materials are much less understood when compared with their crystalline counterparts. This is primarily because of the disordered nature of the amorphous structure which makes that even defining structural defects becomes a very challenging task. In our recent work, by combing the conventional MD method with a highly efficient swap MC algorithm, we have successfully produced computer metallic glass models with an effective cooling rate approaching that typically used in experiments. This hybrid simulation scheme thus allowed us to bridge the vast timescale gap that has been a long-standing concern for comparing lab glasses with the computer-simulated ones. Further analysis of the slowly-quenched glass has revealed that shear transformation zones (STZs) are considerably fewer and smaller than previously believed and cannot be attributed to clear-cut local defects that can be predefined in the glass structure.

For silicate glasses, we have recently investigated their mechanical behavior under tensile loading using large-scale MD simulations. It is found that the non-linear elastic properties of the glasses originate from the combined effect of heterogeneous response of the network structure and the stress-relaxing local coordination environment variations of the alkali modifiers. We also found a composition-mediated brittle-to-ductile transition of the nanoscale fracture behavior of the glasses, which can be related to the change of heterogeneities in various atomic-level properties.

## 3) Monolayer surface properties of oxide glasses

Surface properties lie at the core of many applications of silicate glasses. In our recent work we have combined large-scale classical MD simulations with (DFT-based) first-principles calculations to investigate the characteristics of silicate glass surfaces on the level of single atomic layer. Our MD simulations revealed the presence of structural defects that are potential reactive sites on the surfaces; their vibrational and electronic signatures were further identified jointly from the classical and ab initio simulations. Moreover, the large-scale simulations allowed us to study the topographical features of the melt-quenched surface and the fracture surface of the glasses. It is revealed that the roughness of the melt-quenched surface is considerably smaller than that of the fracture surface. In contrast to experimental findings, we find that the fracture surface exhibits a logarithmic scaling of the surface height fluctuation, indicating that it is not fractal object on the nanometer scale.

## 4) Irradiation response of multi-principal element alloys

High- and medium-entropy alloys (H/MEAs) are an emerging type of materials with great potentials in both structural and nuclear applications. Recent studies have shown that a salient feature that sets these alloys apart from pure metals and dilute solid solutions is their chemical complexities in the form of local chemical order (LCO). Combining atomistic simulations with in situ ion irradiation experiments, we demonstrated for a representative CrCoNi MEA that increased LCO significantly enhances its resistance to irradiation damage by narrowing the mobility ratio of irradiation-induced interstitials and
vacancies that can facilitate their recombination.  This finding opens an avenue towards the design of structurally and chemically complex materials with superior irradiation tolerance.
